## About

I found this theme thankfully at a video of [Theo](https://github.com/TheoBr) and i loved it. I also love customizint my terminal.

Warp does have a similar Theme like poimandres, which is [Fancy Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) but just a little off. So I decided to create my own poimandres theme for warp.

There's not alot of customization options on warp so feel free to suggest any fixes.
